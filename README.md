🚀 Introducing PumpXfun: The Ultimate Solana Bundler with 13 Powerful Functions! 🚀

Hey Solana traders!

I’m excited to announce that I’ve just launched PumpXfun, a powerful bundling tool for maximizing your Solana trades on Pump.Fun and Raydium! 🎉

With 13 unique functions designed to optimize your trading strategies, you’ll be able to:

Launch & Bundle Buy – Execute trades with up to 22 wallets simultaneously for maximum impact.
Generate New Wallets – Automatically generate wallets for every new launch.
Create Vanity Wallets – Customize your wallets for added branding or personal use.
Check Wallet Balances – Keep track of all your wallet balances in one place.
Recover Sol from Subwallets – Automatically recover SOL after selling your launched tokens.
Fund Wallets – Easily fund wallets for bundle buy operations.
Dump Tokens – Dump tokens across Pump.Fun and Raydium with ease.
Dump % from All Wallets – Optimize liquidity by dumping a percentage of tokens from all wallets.
Targeted Dumping – Dump specific percentages from individual wallets for precision.
Dump Token Amount – Liquidate tokens by specifying the exact amount to dump on both platforms.
Warm-Up Mode – Execute random trades to avoid Photon flags and maintain a clean profile.
Bumping – Buy and sell to increase token visibility and drive attention to your launch.
Snipe Tokens – Precision sniping for your own or other tokens for strategic positioning.
